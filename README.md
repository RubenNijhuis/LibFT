# LibFT
 ðŸ›  Custom basic C library used for the '21 Codam curriculum

## Installation
This project assumes you have Make installed, otherwise you can copy paste the commands into your terminal
Clone the repo and compile it.

```bash
# Clone:
$ git clone https://github.com/RubenNijhuis/LibFT.git

# Compile:
$ Make all

This will output the `.o` files and create an `libft.a` file in the LibFT directory, copy this file to your project.
```

## Usage

Add this line to your .c file
`#include "libft.h`

And add the libft.a file to your project.

## Notes
This project started during my academic year '21 at Codam. Due to a norm they have for the code certain functions
might be written in 'interesting' ways. In most cases these functions would be written in a differently structured
way improving speed or memory usage.

This library will scale with the functionality I require during my time at Codam. Therefore some functions that might
be obvious for you to use won't be added as I don't have a use for them.

Happy coding: :)
